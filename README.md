# gpslogger
small android-app to log gps coordinates

## overview
with this android-app you can record gps-data for example to
record routes. 

Then you can share the recorded ways per mail and use the
raw gps-data i.e. to draw routes in google maps.

## development
I finished the development of the app. maybe i will add some improvements
if i have time. Feel free to open Pull requests if you find bugs or want
to improve the app!
